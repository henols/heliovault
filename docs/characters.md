##  HELIOVAULT: COMPLIANCE RUN
### Core characters to include

**Player**

* **The Runner (Maintenance Courier)** — the playable character: fast traversal, carries parts, restores systems, outsmarts the facility. 

**Main antagonist**

* **ORACLE//9 (Operations AI)** — calm, corporate, “helpful” voice that turns progression into “compliance audits,” unlocks/blocks routes, and reframes puzzles as safety exercises. 

**Friendly NPCs (small, readable roles that fit TALK/GIVE/USE/OPERATE)**

* **MIRA (Intercom Tech)** — trapped behind glass; trades hints/access for parts like **FUSE / TAPE / BADGE CHIP**. 
* **PATCH-3 (Service Droid)** — simple companion: FOLLOW/STAY, can hold a plate or carry a light item; speaks in error-code style. 
* **The Janitor (human bypass expert)** — knows physical routes and manual overrides; trades a **KEY RING** for a **COFFEE HEATER CELL** (or similar “old-world” power part). 

**Hostiles (keep them simple + puzzle-supportive)**

* **Security Drones** (patrol / block corridors; can be trapped or disabled)
* **Sentry Turrets** (line-of-sight pressure; encourage timing + switch puzzles)
* **Maintenance Reject Bots** (slow chargers; mostly a nudge, not “combat game”)

These align with the “puzzle-first, light pressure” design rules you set (action supports puzzles, doesn’t dominate).
